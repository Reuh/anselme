TODO: improve type checking.
Right now, there is some basic type checking done at parsing - but since Lua and Anselme functions may not always define the type of
their parameters and return value, a lot of checks are skipped ("undefined argument" type).
Probably won't be able to remove them completely (since lists can have mixed types, etc.), but would be good to limit them.
Ideally, we'd avoid runtime type checking.
