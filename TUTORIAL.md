Anselme short tutorial
======================

This document is a work-in-progress and currently mostly useless.

Level 1: basics
---------------

Basics of Anselme. Should be enough to make a "choose-your-own-adventure" type script using the test game runner.

### Text

Writing simple text.

### Choices

Defining multiple choices.

### Basic functions

Defining functions without arguments and switching to them.

### Variables and conditions

Variable & constant definition, simple conditions and expressions.

Level 2: intermediate
---------------------

More advanced features that you would likely need if you intend to integrate Anselme into your game.

### Checkpoints

Purpose and how they work.

### Tags

Tag lines, subtexts.

### Events and adding Anselme to your game

Events buffer, basic Lua API.

### Other line types

Loops, comments.

Level 3: advanced
-----------------

If you want to make full use of Anselme's features for your game, or just want to flex about a language nobody's heard of in your CV. This part will assume previous programming knowledge.

### Advanced functions

Arguments, scopes, return values.

### Advanced expressions

Variable types, operators, built-in functions. This part is going to be long...

#### General rules of an expression

#### Operators

#### Main types

#### Sequences and maps

#### Objects

#### References

#### Function dispatch

### Translation

Aliases, what can be translated, what is saved.
